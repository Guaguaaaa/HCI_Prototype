# HCI_Chatbot_Prototype

This repository contains a prototype for a human-computer interaction (HCI) chatbot interface. The prototype is designed to showcase two different versions of a chatbot: one with an integrated eXplainable AI (XAI) component and one without.

## Overview

The main purpose of this project is to provide a functional front-end prototype of a chatbot that can be used for HCI research and development. It demonstrates how an XAI component can be integrated into a chat interface to provide users with explanations of the chatbot's behavior.

The prototype consists of the following components:

* **Homepage (`index.html`)**: The main entry point of the application, which provides links to the two chatbot versions.
* **Non-XAI Chatbot (`html/non-XAI_version.html`)**: A standard chat interface where a user can interact with an AI model.
* **XAI Integrated Chatbot (`html/XAI_Version.html`)**: An extended chat interface that includes a dedicated section for displaying XAI explanations alongside the conversation. This version also includes emoji controls to simulate user feedback on the AI's emotional state.

## Features

* **Two Chatbot Versions**: Easily compare and contrast a chatbot with and without an XAI interface.
* **Simple and Clean UI**: The user interface is built with standard HTML and CSS for easy understanding and modification.
* **Interactive Elements**: The XAI version includes interactive elements like emoji feedback buttons.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to work on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
* **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
* **JavaScript**: For handling user interactions and simulating chatbot responses.
